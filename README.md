#My portfolio Website
This project is a simple portfolio website created using HTML and basic CSS. 
It includes two main pages: a Home page that introduces my profile and a 
Contact page that allows visitors to reach out to me. The project focuses on 
practicing fundamental web development concepts such as page structure, 
navigation, and basic styling with a clean and simple design.
